This package includes a number of HTML "tours" of the sky using the aladin-lite framework.  It is documented at 
aladin.cds.unistra.fr/
https://aladin.cds.unistra.fr/AladinLite/doc/

We are extending aladin-lite with some additional tools in javascript and css to turn the interactive viewer into a semi-interactive tour.
tour-common.js and draggable.js contain most of the important code.


Avoid using try/except clauses in python to catch mistakes.  Try/except should only be used to catch known and well-understood errors, and even then, very sparingly.


Avoid creating a lot of extra files.  Check if there is already a file in place that can be reused or adapted before creating a new one.  For example, instead of making a new job submission script, modify or upgrade the current one if possible.   If you end up making new submission jobs for one-off test submissions, clean them up afterward.

When on hipergator (hostnames like c0712a-s17.ufhpc), use a conda environment, never the system python.
