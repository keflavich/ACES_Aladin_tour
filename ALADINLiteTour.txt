ALADIN Lite Tour

https://www.cefca.es/cefca_en/tour_navigator_library


Help me write code that will:
(1) convert a FITS file (e.g., 12m_continuum_commonbeam_circular_mosaic.fits) to an ALADIN HIPS file using a colorscheme in matplotlib that transitions from grayscale to hot
(2) create an ALADIN Lite tour (e.g., see @https://www.cefca.es/cefca_en/tour_navigator_library )
(3) in that tour, zoom in and then pan across the image


We're trying to make an Aladin Lite tour using HIPS for the display.  You made it most of the way through last time, but we need to fix some things.

fits_to_hips is adding a colorbar that doesn't belong
